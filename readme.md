## Moroccan Cooking Companion 🇲🇦🍽️

> This is a simple web application that allows users to search for traditional Moroccan dishes and get the recipe with images. 
> The application is built using Spring Boot / Spring AI, Hilla from Vaadin.


💡 This application is not business oriented and my focus is mostly on technical part, I just want to play with [Spring AI 🍃](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-ai) and [Vaadin's Hilla ⚛️](https://hilla.dev/) project.

🌀 This Application is `in-progress` and I will add new features over time.
