## Moroccan Cooking Companion 🇲🇦🍽️

> A web application that allows users to search for traditional Moroccan dishes and retrieve their recipes along with mouthwatering images. Built with Spring Boot, Spring AI, and Hilla from Vaadin for a seamless and user-friendly experience.

💡 This project is focused on learning and experimenting with the [Spring AI 🍃](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-ai) and [Vaadin's Hilla ⚛️](https://hilla.dev/) technologies. It's not aimed at building a business application but rather serves as a playground to explore the capabilities of these innovative frameworks and gain hands-on experience with AI engineering and seamless Spring Boot-React integration.

🌀 This Application is `in-progress` and I will add new features over time.
